# Linux-file-management-and-directory-creation

Open Kali linux


![linux1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dfeacaf-544a-4327-9a52-104a28becf68)

Open Terminal 

![linux2 ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee43db4-486f-498f-8450-563369972bc9)

use the "ls" command to list directories

![linux3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c68f83e-7ab8-4fb1-985f-aa377dabee5b)

use the "touch" command to create a file, in this case I named the file github 

![linux4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/251314fd-9bbd-4c17-bb3e-35011a4c35b8)

Verify the file was made by using the "ls" command again


![linux5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76dd8c87-ea0b-4dc5-92a5-768cedb815c0)

Now I created a directory for this file name "Projects" do this by using the "mkdir" command which is used to make directories. 

![linux6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6df830c6-9e7d-46b8-92e5-03f829efe427)

Verify the directory was made by using the "ls" command again

![linux7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53d0bf76-c65b-423f-969f-c6ebde27d66f)

Now move the github file by using the "mv" command, this command moves or renames a file. 

In this case with moved the file by typing "mv github [the file name] Projects [the directory we want the file to movev to]

Obverse that the file has been move into the Projects directory 

![linux8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f01f66d3-5158-4bf5-9bca-af7db4868f67)

We verify the file has been move by changing directories using the "cd" command, followed by the "ls" commmand to view whats in the directory

![linux9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d7d1bd0-c9f2-4eeb-bf54-0e62939ae10e)


Now we are going to change the file name from github to gitprojects by useing the "mv" command. This command can move a file from one place to another or change file names.
As shown in the example below

![linux10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0e0a7d3-97b4-4e2d-a6cf-74dae072c282)


Verify the filename by using the "ls" command again
